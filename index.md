My name is _José R. Nicolás-Carlock_, I’m a physicist and _complexity scientist_ with interest in social phenomena (corruption, crime and society). I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Legal Research of Mexico's UNAM. My [research](https://jrncarlock.github.io/research/) deals with the interdisciplinary study of enforced disappearances and corruption using [data, networks and complex systems science](https://jrncarlock.github.io/outreach/) approaches.
