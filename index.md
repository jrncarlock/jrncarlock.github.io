I’m a physicist and _complexity scientist_ with interest in social phenomena. My current [research](https://jrncarlock.github.io/research/) deals with the interdisciplinary study of enforced disappearances, corruption and impunity, from [data, networks and complex systems](https://jrncarlock.github.io/outreach/) approaches.
