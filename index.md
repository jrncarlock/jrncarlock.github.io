My name is _José R. Nicolás-Carlock_, I’m a physicist and complexity scientist with interest in social phenomena. I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Legal Research of Mexico's UNAM where my [research](https://jrncarlock.github.io/research/) deals with the interdisciplinary study of enforced disappearances, corruption and impunity, using [data, networks and complex systems](https://jrncarlock.github.io/outreach/) approaches.
